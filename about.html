We saw a quartet of the Herculean 627 HP Seven Marine outboard engines gracing the transom of a Hydra-Sports 53 Suenos center console fishing boat;
we saw an Intrepid 475 Sport Yacht with quad 557 HP Seven Marine outboards; and we saw a Midnight Express 43 with a brace of outboards totaling 2,228 horses on its tail. Gigantic outboard engines—and lots of them—ruled the water at the Fort Lauderdale show,
proving that in this day and age many kinds of boats can truly be called a speed boat.
